This is a project made with Java that implements the round robin algorithm

When you run the application a few prompts will appear in the command prompt
Firstly, you can choose how many and if you want to manually enter your paramenters for the processes of the application.
If not, then you will need to define maximum arrival time and burst time.
If yes you can manually add each processes name, arrival time, burst time and priority.
Afterwards, two tables will appear. The one has each process listed based on its priority,
and the other based on their arrival time.
Then, you will need to type in the time quantom you prefer, and afterwards the algorithm will run
telling you what process is being excecuted in each tick.
In the end it will show the average response and turnaround time

!!If a process has the same priority as another then the one with the shortest arrival time is picked!!
