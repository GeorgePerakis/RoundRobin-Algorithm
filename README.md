When you run the application a few prompts will appear in the command prompt
Firstly, you can choose how many and if you want to manually enter your paramenters for the processes of the application.
If no, then you will need to define maximum arrival time and burst time.
If yes you can manually add each processes name, arrival time, burst time and priority.
Afterwards, two tables will appear. The one has each process listed based on its priority,
and the other based on their arrival time.
Then, you will need to type in the time quantom and afterwards the algorithm will run telling you what
process is being excecuted in each tick.
In the end it will show average response and turnaround time
